title: Overview of RKE
description: RKE solves Kubernetes installation complexity. With RKE, Kubernetes installation is simplified, regardless of what OSs and platforms youâ€™re running.

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. RKE solves the problem of installation complexity, a common issue in the Kubernetes community. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes is both simplified and easily automated, and it's entirely independent of the operating system and platform you're running. As long as you can run a supported version of Docker, you can deploy and run Kubernetes with RKE.
